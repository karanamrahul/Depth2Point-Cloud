# Depth Image to Point Cloud Conversion

This ROS2 package converts depth frames from a ROSbag file into point cloud frames and transmits them as ROS messages. The converted point cloud frames can be visualized using ROS2 Rviz.

#### Tasks


- [ ] Optimize the conversion algorithm for a pipeline operating at 50 frames per second.
- [ ] Implement the ROS2 node in C++.
- [ ] Create a ROSBag of the generated point cloud messages.
- [ ] Record a short video demonstrating the point cloud visualization in Rviz.
- [ ] Update the README with detailed instructions on setting up and using the package.

#### Data

ROS Bag of depth frames taken from [Luxonics] OAK-D S2(https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM9098s2.html)
